You have arranged to meet a friend at \"Sadang\" Station. Can you easily find your way there? If the text appears jumbled or difficult to read, you are experiencing a small glimpse of what people with dyslexia encounter in daily life. Even something as simple as a subway map can feel like a confusing puzzle. How would you navigate if this were your everyday reality?"),
    
    DyslexiaInEveryDaySentence(text: "Something seems a bit off, doesn’t it? If you look at the diagram, it shows a diameter of 7 cm. That means the radius should be 3.5 cm. But the problem states that the radius is 5.3 cm—something doesn’t add up! And what about the second question? The words look a little scrambled. Can you still read them easily? Imagine if every test you took looked like this. Would you be able to focus on solving problems, or would you spend all your time just trying to read them?"),
    
    DyslexiaInEveryDaySentence(text: "Huh? Something seems strange here! Is a side of bacon really $50? That’s more expensive than the main dish! And take a look at the grand total—it doesn’t add up to the sum of the listed prices. Also, do some of the words look a little off? What if every receipt you received looked like this? Would you be able to check if you were charged correctly?"),
    
    DyslexiaInEveryDaySentence(text: "Did you read the gate number as E9? Did you think your seat was 53A? Actually, your gate number is 39, and your seat number is 35A. Imagine if you frequently misread important details like this while traveling. You might end up waiting at the wrong gate or even sitting in the wrong seat. For people with dyslexia, this kind of confusion happens all the time."),
    
    
    DyslexiaInEveryDaySentence(text: "Huh? Something seems strange here! Look closely at the menu—some of the letters seem mixed up, and a few words don’t look quite right. Can you still read them easily? Even the category titles look unusual! Does \"C0ffee\" seem right to you? And what about \"Geen Tea\" or \"Grapefurit Aide\"? Now, imagine if every menu you saw looked like this. Would you be able to confidently order what you wanted?")
